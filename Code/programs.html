            <h2>Anger and Stress Management</h2>
            <h3> - by Dr.Shweta Nanda</h3>
            <h4>
                <p>
                    Anger is a normal, healthy emotion. However, it can be a problem if you find it difficult to keep it under control.
                    Everyone has a physical reaction to anger. Be aware of what your body is telling you, and take steps to calm yourself down.
                    Once you can recognise that youâ€™re getting angry, and can calm yourself down, you can start looking at ways to control your anger more generally. 

                    Stress can be one of the major factors that leads to anger.
                    Bring down your general stress levels with exercise and relaxation. 
                    Running, walking, swimming, yoga and meditation are just a few activities that can reduce stress.
